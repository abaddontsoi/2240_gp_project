Group Number: 203A2
Group Leader: TSOI Yiu Chik
Proposal Mark: 7 / 10

Q1 - description
The goal and benefit of the system may need some explanations.
Is it a business management solution for a retail store?

Q2 - data to be stored
You should explain the overall purpose of the data fields.
Instead of just a list of field/table names.

Q3 - users
The user section is well written with clear explanation.

Q4 - usage
Given a team of 4 members, we would expect more detailed operations in the database.
The scope of the project may need to be larger than just managing the products, and financial records.

Language and grammar:
The report writing style seems quite complicated. You may shorten the sentences to simplify them.
For example, "Since this database is to design for storage usage, 
the purpose of this database is to manage every trade record, 
store product cost, store product information, 
calculate total income and total spend, calculate total stock of product, etc."
The above sentence could be splitted into a few sentences.
"This database is designed for storing business related records.
This would include trading record, product storage cost, financial related records and other related records."

Overall
The overall project idea need to be more specific.
The scope of the project may need to expand a bit for a team of 4.
